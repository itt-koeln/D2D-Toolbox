## Tool Manual

### _a. Tool Oveview_

The Urban Water Accounting tool is a systematic quantitative assessment framework designed for municipalities to track and manage the flow of water within urban environments. 
This tool facilitates the accounting of water quantities sourced from natural bodies (like rivers and groundwater), utilized by various sectors (e.g., households, industries, and commercial units), and returned to the environment

### _b. Tool Usage Steps_

Users of the Urban Water Accounting Tool must systematically navigate three critical phases: **boundary definition, comprehensive data collection, and precise data entry,** which collectively provide a holistic approach to urban water system analysis

##### 1. Boundaries Definition

•	Spatial: Determine the geographical area covered by your analysis (e.g., city limits, watershed boundaries).
•	Temporal: Specify the time period for data collection (e.g., annual, monthly).

##### 2. Data Collection

Before entering data, it is crucial to understand the key components of the urban water system: 
•	Water Sources: Natural or artificial reservoirs from which water is extracted for urban use, including surface water (rivers, lakes) and groundwater aquifers.
•	Water Supply: The infrastructure and processes used to collect, treat, and distribute water to users, including treatment plants and distribution networks
•	Water Users: Various sectors consuming water, such as residential, commercial, industrial, and public facilities
•	Water Treatment: Facilities and processes that clean and purify wastewater before it's returned to the environment
•	Water Discharge: The release of treated wastewater back into natural water bodies or for reuse purposes.
To gather the necessary data: 
1.	Identify relevant stakeholders for each component (e.g., water utilities, industrial users, treatment plant operators).
2.	Contact these stakeholders directly to request the required information.
3.	Consult the guidelines provided with the Urban Water Accounting Tool for specific data sources and collection methods.

##### 3. Data Entry

Once you have collected the necessary information, proceed to enter the data into the four sheets of the Excel file: 
1.	Water Supply Sheet:<br> 
o	Enter data on water sources, extraction volumes, and supply infrastructure.<br>
o	Include information on water treatment processes and distribution networks.
2.	Water Discharge Sheet:<br>
o	Input data on wastewater collection, treatment processes, and discharge volumes.<br>
o	Include information on any water reuse or recycling initiatives.
3.	Flow Diagram Sheet:<br> 
o	Use this sheet to create a visual representation of water flows through your urban system.<br>
o	Ensure all major components and connections are accurately depicted.
4.	Performance Indicators Sheet:<br> 
o	Enter relevant data to calculate key performance indicators.<br>
o	These may include water use efficiency, treatment effectiveness, and system losses.

By following these steps and utilizing the Urban Water Accounting Tool, municipalities and water managers can gain valuable insights into their water systems, enabling more informed decision-making and sustainable water resource management.

## Study Case

In the case study of Sariharjo, Indonesia, where we applied our urban water accounting tool on an annual base, Figure 16 illustrates a portion of the water flows between different components (environment, economies, and households), while Table 6 presents the values of some of the performance indicators. Unfortunately, due to data scarcity, we were unable to compute all elements of the urban water accounting framework for this case study.

| Indicator Category               | Indicator Name              | Definition                                                                                                                                  | Units         | Value     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Population and water use intensity | Intensity of water use       | The ratio of the sum of water utilized by the different sectors divided by the total area.                                                   | GL/year/Km²   | 0.44      |
| Overall balance of inputs and outputs | Inputs/outputs              | The ratio of the total volume of water flowing from environment to the economies divided by the water flowing from the economies to the environment | -             | 99.826%   |
| Water system centralization      | Supply centralization (%)     | Ratio of total water supplied from municipal water collection, treatment and supply to the different users                                  | %             | 8%        |
| Water system centralization      | Supply decentralized (%)      | Ratio of total water either extracted directly from nature (from rivers, groundwater, rainfall harvesting) or supplied from trucks.         | %             | 92%       |
| Wastewater potential for water supply | Total use replaceability   | Ratio of the total water discharged from the economies to the environment (except urban runoff) divided by the total water volume used by the different users | %             | 65%       |

Based on the provided performance indicators we can conclude that:<br> 
•	**Intensity of water use (0.44 GL/year/Km²):** This low value suggests that a large portion of the annual precipitation likely follows natural water cycles (infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration) rather than being consumed by human activities. While for the built-up areas, it could indicate limited water infrastructure and usage in the developed parts of the village.<br>
•	**Inputs/outputs ratio (99.826%):** The near-balance between water inflows and outflows implies minimal water retention or loss within the system, suggesting efficient water cycling.<br>
•	**Supply centralization (8%) vs. decentralization (92%):** The high decentralization rate indicates heavy reliance on direct extraction methods (i.e., groundwater) rather than municipal supply, which may present challenges for water quality control and sustainable management.<br> 
•	**Total use replaceability (65%):** This moderate value suggests significant potential for wastewater reuse, indicating opportunities to enhance water efficiency and reduce freshwater demand.

Based on the provided performance indicators and their interpretations, we can recommend the following:<br> 
•	**Enhance Water Infrastructure in Built-Up Areas:** The low intensity of water use (0.44 GL/year/Km²) suggests limited water infrastructure. Investments in expanding and upgrading water supply systems in Sariharjo could improve access and efficiency.<br> 
•	**Promote Decentralized Water Management:** With 92% of water supply being decentralized, efforts should focus on improving the quality, monitoring, and sustainability of decentralized sources especially groundwater. This could include implementing regulations, providing technical support, and encouraging community-based management.<br> 
•	**Increase Wastewater Reuse:** The 65% total use replaceability highlights significant potential for wastewater reuse. Introducing or expanding wastewater treatment facilities and promoting treated wastewater for non-potable uses (e.g., irrigation or industrial processes) could reduce freshwater demand.<br> 
•	**Integrate Nature-Based Solutions (NBS):** To complement existing systems, consider implementing NBS such as permeable pavements to enhance water retention, reduce runoff, and improve water quality.<br> 
•	**Strengthen Data Collection Systems:** The near-balance in inputs/outputs (99.826%) indicates efficient water cycling but may also mask unaccounted losses due to limited data. Installing metering systems at the village level and improving data collection on water flows would provide more accurate insights for planning.<br> 
•	**Encourage Public-Private Partnerships:** Collaborations with private entities can bring expertise and funding to improve infrastructure, implement innovative technologies, and enhance system efficiency.<br> 
•	**Promote Awareness and Community Engagement:** Educating communities about sustainable water use practices and involving them in decentralized water management can foster long-term resilience.
