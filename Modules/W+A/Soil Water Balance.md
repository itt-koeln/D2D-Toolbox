The soil water balance
The soil water balance is a numerical calculation that accounts for the inputs, outputs and volume changes in a given volume of soil at a given time.

𝐼𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑠=𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡𝑠±𝑑𝑆∕𝑑𝑡
 dS/dt is the variation in storage over time
 

 The soil water balance can be used to:
 Assess the biophysical activity of plants
 Assess the efficiency of irrigation systems
 Understand the behaviour of key hydrologic variables
 Strengthen agricultural management through evidence-based decision making
