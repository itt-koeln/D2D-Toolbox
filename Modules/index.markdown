About the Toolbox

1. Background

Water, energy, and food security become one of the key challenges and a major concern for both science and policy. It is generally acknowledged that an improved management of the available water and natural resources can be achieved by enhancing the science-policy interface and by linking research and innovation more systematically. However, the intercommunication of research needs and research results between policy-makers and researchers is often inefficient, especially in developing countries. The gap between science and policy can be bridged by enhancing the interfaces between policymakers and researchers using innovative approaches of co-design to establish a Knowledge and Innovation Platform (KIP).

This platform links the practice and research community related to a certain region or theme â€“ involving actors from science, policy, business, and civil society.

For this purpose, the D2D Toolbox is designed as a platform to provide scientists, policymakers, and professionals with comprehensive tools to analyze the problem, co-development of the required knowledge and then communicate the results for better decision making and implementation.

2. Development of the Toolbox

The D2D Toolbox provides an overview of available data, methods, and tools regarding the assessment modeling and scenarios of water and natural resources often need for monitoring or reaching the sustainable development goals.

The categories of the toolbox are data collection, data analysis, data processing, information creation, and knowledge transfer (compare fig 2). It provides tools to access and to analyze monitoring data from in-situ sources as well as from remote sensing products. Models are needed to understand the dynamics of water supply and demand as well as water-related ecosystem services, to assess intervention options at the technical, socio-economic or policy level and to develop scenarios, as well as develop indicators to provide decision makers by some basis for evaluating if the set goals are met.

Each Toolbox will be developed in cooperation with relevant decision makers and local research partners (typically a university) (see figure 3) and disseminated through user-specific training packages both in the partner countries as well as e-learning based for a broader audience. After analyzing the decision-making process, the basic structure of the Toolbox will be developed and subsequently applied to an identified pilot areas. The design will be realized for each pilot application together with a local research partner and a central implementation partner. The local partners will be trained in the technical application and expansion of the toolbox as well as in the use of appropriate media for effective communication of project results.
