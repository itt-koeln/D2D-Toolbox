## 1. Background
Land cover maps play a significant role in planning, management, and monitoring at local, regional, national, and global levels (for both scientific and administrative purposes). For ensuring sustainable land development, it is necessary to monitor the land cover dynamics and change patterns over time in response to economic, social, political, and environmental factors. It is therefore necessary that authorities receive continuous and reliable information on land cover so that every bit of available land can be used in the most rational and optimal ways.

## 2. Principle
Remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in monitoring land cover changes by providing consistent, objective, and up-to-date data across large geographic areas. Utilizing satellite-based products, these techniques can capture high-resolution images that reveal shifts in landscapes over time and across space, such as deforestation, urban expansion, or agricultural development. The multi-temporal and multi-spectral data that land cover remote sensing products offer enable scientists and policymakers to assess trends, evaluate the impact of human activities, and implement effective land management strategies.

There are many freely-accessible remote sensing land cover products, and these products have different spatial and temporal resolutions and coverages. They also have different accuracies in capturing different land cover types. It is therefore important to carefully choose or evaluate the product(s) before use. In cases where ground data are scarce, a cross-comparison can be helpful. Once a suitable product is identified, it can be used to delineate land cover(s) over the target area within a defined period of time.
